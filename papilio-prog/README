To prepare an ubuntu system to compile the application:
	sudo apt-get install git autogen automake g++ libftdi-dev

To bootstrap the build system:

	./autogen.sh

This will generate the configure string and various autotools dependencies.
Then, to compile a linux binary ("papilio-prog"):

	./configure && make

Or to generate a windows binary ("papilio-prog.exe"):

	./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-linux && make

That is assuming you have MinGW installed. On Debian and Ubuntu systems,
"apt-get mingw64" should be all that's needed.

The windows binary will still need the FTDI driver DLL installed on the
system to work.
